Online e-commerce, created during the web development course, using Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript. Fully functional and responsive up to checkout. This is my first complete web application. 

The request to the server is made using the AJAX technique and the response received from the server is mapped to JavaScript classes.

From the admin page you can manage the products database. This page is just a graphical interface, which communicates through AJAX requests with a server, using the verbs GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to add and update the list of available products.
 
The page is hosted on GitHub Pages and the JSON database is hosted on mockapi.io.
The code also contains what's necesary to deploy with npm.


Technologies used:

- Created with pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap library
- Font-awesome icons library
- AJAX method to fetch data
- npm
