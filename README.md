# Books_And_Coffee_Shop

Online e-commerce, created during the web development course, using Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript. Fully functional and responsive up to checkout. This is my first complete web application. 
 
The page is hosted on GitHub Pages and the json database is hosted on mockapi.io.
The code also contains what's necesary to deploy with npm.
